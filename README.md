## Project Overview

This repository contains the final deliverables for the **Beats by Dr. Dre Consumer Insights Data Analytics Externship**, where I applied various **data analysis techniques** to analyze consumer reviews, extract actionable insights, and provide recommendations to inform **business strategies** for a leading audio brand.

### Externship Summary
As part of this **4-week, fully remote externship**, I focused on performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **sentiment analysis**, and deriving **consumer insights** from **Amazon product reviews**. By leveraging Python and data science libraries, I explored patterns in customer feedback, developed visualizations, and identified trends that influence Beats by Dre's brand perception and product strategies.

## Key Skills and Techniques

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered underlying patterns and trends in the consumer reviews dataset.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Performed sentiment analysis using **NLTK** and **TextBlob** to gauge customer sentiment and identify key positive and negative aspects of Beats by Dre products.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create clear visualizations that illustrate findings.
- **Consumer Insights**: Interpreted customer feedback to develop actionable insights for Beats by Dreâ€™s product strategies.
  
## Project Deliverables

1. **Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob and NLTK**: 
   - Used **NLTK** and **TextBlob** to process and analyze customer reviews. The analysis helped identify common positive and negative sentiments.
   - Scripts: `Week_Two_Deliverables_Beats_By_Dre.ipynb`, `NLTK_and_TextBlob_Tutorial_&_Exercises.ipynb`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted EDA on the cleaned Amazon reviews dataset to uncover insights on product satisfaction, identify outliers, and examine distributions.
   - Scripts: `Descriptive_Statistics_for_Beats_by_Dre_Reviews_Dataset.ipynb`, `Visualization_with_Matplotlib.ipynb`, `Visualization_With_Seaborn.ipynb`

3. **Final Capstone Project**:
   - Developed a comprehensive final report summarizing key findings, visualizations, and strategic recommendations for Beats by Dre based on data analysis.
   - Script: `Week_5_Capstone_Project_(Deliverable)_Beats_By_Dre.ipynb`

## Datasets

- **Cleaned Amazon Reviews Dataset**: Contains customer reviews for Beats by Dre products, scraped from Amazon. The dataset was used for sentiment analysis and EDA.
  - File: `cleaned_amazon_reviews.csv`

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, TextBlob
- **Data Source**: Amazon Product Reviews
