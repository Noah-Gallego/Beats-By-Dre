These little Bluetooth speakers are impressive!! I'm starting an outdoor movie night here in my very small town. These will work perfectly! But...hey Oontz....how about a linkable Bluetooth bottom firing subwoofer?? That would be killer!!Loud & Clear! Great Buy here!Happy 4th of July!!I use this for music and as a sound source for the projector TV.Size...battery life...sound quality...easy of use...All on Point!! I was shocked at the sound quality that came out of a speaker approximately the side of a 12oz beverage can.You won't regret this Bluetooth speaker purchase!! I'll be buying a second one ASAP.Edited:I've read reviews saying this speaker \"doesn't produce bass\". That's a lie...lol. For a $20 speaker the bass is way better than I thought it would be. The passive radiator can be heard and is working. It's not a $100+ speaker so it shouldn't be compared to one.

A journey that began with a sprinkle of skepticism has metamorphosed into an unrivaled relationship between man and machine. This isn't just a Bluetooth speaker; it's a harmonious blend of top-notch sound engineering, aesthetic beauty, and unparalleled functionality, ensuring every listening moment is a treat for the senses.While it's a temptation to be swayed by the plethora of high points, the aim of this review is to offer a balanced perspective. I will delve deep into the many admirable qualities but also pinpoint areas that have room for improvement.üîä Phenomenal Sound Quality and Clarity: The first time I connected my smartphone to the OontZ Angle 3 and played some tunes, I couldn't help but marvel at the depth of the sound. With 10 watts of audio power, the speaker projects crystal clear sound even at high volumes without any distortion. Whether I'm streaming classical music, hip-hop, or an intriguing podcast, the audio fidelity remains consistently impressive. The bass, often the Achilles heel for many portable speakers, is surprisingly robust, enriching my playlist with full, resonant low notes that never overpower the melody.üå¶ Robust Durability with IPX5 Rating: What caught my eye was the IPX5 water-resistant rating. I tested it out on a family beach day, and let's just say this little beast can take a splash and still belt out your favorite tunes like nothing happened. This feature makes it a perfect companion for outdoor adventures, bringing a newfound resilience to the world of portable speakers.üì± Swift and Stable Connectivity: Compatibility and connectivity are the unsung heroes of any wireless device. The Bluetooth 5.0 technology ensures the OontZ Angle 3 pairs smoothly with all kinds of devices‚Äîbe it Android, iOS, Windows, or Mac. What's more, it maintains this connection tenaciously, making annoying dropouts a thing of the past.üé® Aesthetic and Functional Design: Beyond its robust engineering, the OontZ Angle 3 is a visual delight. Its sleek black body, complemented by discreet control buttons, is as functional as it is stylish. The design is intuitive, with the rubberized exterior not only providing an elegant aesthetic but also a comfortable grip, ensuring it won't easily tumble over if you're partying a little too hard.üîã Exceptional Battery Life: With its long-lasting battery, the OontZ Angle 3 pushes the boundaries of what portable speakers can achieve. I managed to get close to a full day of usage at moderate volume levels on a single charge. The freedom this affords you, especially when you're outdoors or away from a power source, is genuinely liberating.However, to give a balanced view, it's only fair to bring up an area for potential enhancement:üîò Button Responsiveness: Though generally user-friendly, the tactile feedback on the control buttons could be improved. At times, they require a firm press to register, making me wonder if I've successfully adjusted the volume or skipped a track.To encapsulate, the OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth Speaker earns its 5-star rating without a sliver of doubt. Its minor quirks are inconsequential when stacked against its myriad of features and exceptional performance. With its mesmerizing audio quality, rugged durability, seamless connectivity, stylish design, and robust battery life, it stands head and shoulders above the competition.So if you're looking for a reliable, feature-packed, and exceptional-sounding portable Bluetooth speaker, your search ends here. I wholeheartedly endorse the OontZ Angle 3. It promises an auditory journey that's rewarding, expansive, and full of surprises. And that, in essence, is the purest form of what music or any auditory experience should be‚Äîan enriching journey that tantalizes the senses, one note at a time.I hope this comprehensive review has been enlightening and helps you make an informed decision. Here's to elevating our lives with the power of sound, one beat, one note, and one song at a time. Thank you for taking the time to read, and may your life be a melody of beautiful experiences!","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2023","profile_id":"AG62UD7Q67DBARLYYTGSWHASW33Q","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":16,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R3MXANO58UN4J0","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome sound!","author":"Laretha Stevens","rating":5,"content":"Opened it.

The charging port is a micro USB? Luckily, I happen to have a micro USB charging cord from some piece of technology I must have used some time in the early 2000s (See! Hoarding all of those old cords and placing them in the junk drawer DID pay off!). It is now charging, and when I paired it to my phone, it sounded just as good as my old speaker did. Not really sure how a micro USB port was installed into this speaker, especially when the unit arrived with a provided USB-C charging cord (and the accompanying user manual reflects this as well). Not going to return it, but it's just odd that the accompanying literature, and the cord provided, both indicate a USB-C cord should be used to charge the unit.

Now, after an evening of this speaker being unattended with our puppy, I'm blown away!I will admit, when the package arrived, I was disappointed at the size of the speaker box. \"Crap. This tiny thing is going to screech like nails on a chalkboard,\" I thought. It was destined to be a full-time garage speaker for my husband and his outside tinkerings. I had the thought of a large, deep-bassed speaker that would blast his horrible obsession with Chicago onto the neighborhood. I had expectations of a speaker that would compete with a miter saw or drill. After 10 seconds with this box, my expectations were lowered and I was happy that I bought it through Amazon and their BA return policy since I had the feeling it was getting sent right back. WOW WAS I WRONG!I gave this to him last weekend as a pre-Christmas gift since he was spending 7 hours outside detailing his pickup. (Literally, 6 Hours and 22 Minutes to be exact.) He was very excited to get the speaker and was ecstatic when he was able to easily pair it with his cellphone. I was on standby waiting to help him since he is technologically incompetent. He paired the speaker with his cellphone in under 2 minutes without my help. That is a new record!I was disappointed to see the small charging cable, but we quickly realized that it is compatible with and Micro-charger. I grabbed a spare 2.0 Amp charger with the thought that the battery would need some juice. To my surprise, I walked outside to hear it pumping out tunes and blasting Ambrosia down the driveway. I kept the charger beside the speaker just in case it died. Again, sheer shock that it lasted all afternoon and all evening.I thought this speaker was going to be the replacement for the 20 year old sony boombox in the garage. I thought it was going to be turned on for a few hours every weekend. Within a few hours, I saw my husband carrying it around the house from room to room. From the garage, to the kitchen, to the gun room and then to the bathroom for some shower tunes. He was carrying it around like it was a cellphone or in his case, like he was 7 years old again in 1985 with a battery powered radio.I was surprised at how small it was. It will fit comfortably in someone's hand and the weight of the product is maybe about a pound. It is the size of a Coke can, but the sound that comes from it is impressive. I would have guessed that the sound and the bass would be from a much larger speaker. It could be more crisp and clear yes, but for the size it's a lot of bang for the buck!The volume on the speaker for the size is mind blowing. My husband had it pumping in the garage, and I could hear it through doors and walls 75 feet away.The speaker impressed me once again last night when our puppy ripped off the two rubber ends. \"Well, it was cheap enough that I don't mind buying another one,\" I thought to myself. Just to see what happens, I reassembled the speaker with the now cracked rubbers ends. Surprisingly, the speaker works like it is fresh out of the box! I may order another one to live in our camper full-time!It has withstood my husband and his horrible taste in 80's music, our new Pit Bull and kept a charge for hours. It's small enough to throw in a purse, small bag or even in a decent sized glove compartment. I was disappointed when it first arrived that it wasn't large and obtrusive because in my mind, that is how a speaker relays mind blowing sound. Instead, the times have changed and a speaker like The Oontz that is compact and well designed can out perform the giant-must-be-plugged-in-all-the-time-speakers. I have a $100+ Bluetooth speaker that will remain nameless. I love it the speaker and it projects wonderful sound, but it has to be plugged in constantly to get premium sound. Also, when the speaker is on battery power, it only lasts about 45 minutes. The Oontz has embarrassed the pants off of my \"snotty-high-end-speaker\". Especially how I could get 4 Oontz units for the price of my house speaker. Point: Oontz!This thing started off as a regrettable purchase and quickly progressed to be one of the best presents I have ever purchased. I have been proven wrong and that good things do indeed come in small packages. I have a feeling that this thing is going to be one of those products that is never going to die!!","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2015","profile_id":"AEZJYYMKBBUBTSPKHA22CFYLOYFQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":55,"product_attributes":"Color: Red"},{"id":"RS9B5JTJFEYHZ","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great audio and great value","author":"Av","rating":5,"content":"This speaker rocks.

I only listen to old time radio and podcasts, however, so I'm not able to really say much for music except for a brief test with some classical music. The sound is clear, crisp, and loud enough for me.The unit is small and stable when sitting, and can lay on the bed beside my head or on my pillow at night without rolling off. It would work well on any mostly flat surface.It was very simple to pair Bluetooth with my phone following the directionsAlthough I would prefer actual buttons for controls the little raised sections in the rubber do work and one can feel what they are in the dark if you've given it a good look and memorized their shapes.Battery life seems great. I use it for about 12 hours every night on a charge and it still has charge left.The negatives:The little rubber door for the USB-C is very difficult to open if one doesn't have fingernails. It pretty much closes on its own so you are stuck opening it every time you need to charge.Once open, one will find the metal surround of the USB-C port is not flush so it is difficult to plug in a cable without actually looking at it like one can with a phone or nearly any other USB-C device. If I need to plug in when it's dark, I have to use my phone for some light to get it plugged in. Not thrilled with that.The biggest disappointment is that I cannot skip tracks forward or backward with the volume buttons. I have to use my phone for that. This is the main reason (along with the other two less major issues) for not giving the full 5-star rating.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2023","profile_id":"AEVKEFZWEETWNMTVBEJH4UW6ZUGQ","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R38JZH6GYUU9AS","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars EXCELLENT Battery Life","author":"Barbary","rating":5,"content":"This speaker is a tiny powerhouse with INSANE battery life.
