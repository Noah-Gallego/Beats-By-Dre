EVERYTHINGCompact size does not mean this speaker has compact sound. This speaker is all you need to sync your music with a clear, superior sound boost. I remember the Marshall amps for my punk rock days. This is a replica of the Marshall amps and that's one of the reasons I chose this speaker. Sound quality has not been sacrificed and it is easy to use. It's all you need. I purchased this a week ago and bought another for my son this week. I will most likely purchase one for my hubby because he is using mine all the time, and yes we have different tastes in music. Look at others if you wish, or save time and get this little powerhouse, Marshall.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024","profile_id":"AEAF6N7CEGGH6D4W7EZV3CTY2EIA","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: Emberton"},{"id":"R32TB1MC4FWO7L","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely amazing little speaker!!!","author":"Lillian Salazar","rating":5,"content":"I just got my little Marshall speaker and I am so happy I went with this one!

We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either \"stacking\" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024","profile_id":"AFHFRU22UQRFPEVWBHQFXHBHVYWA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":3,"product_attributes":"Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II"},{"id":"R23X44QGADE8FA","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars My First BT","author":"Kitsune","rating":5,"content":"Its awesome looking as being addicted to concerts :P When I get the chance, I will stack them lol!

Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is.

There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction.

As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023","profile_id":"AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":22,"product_attributes":"Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II"},{"id":"R2ZEE7MB12Q04N","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars You Complete Me","author":"James","rating":5,"content":"Size really doesn't matter, and in the world of speakers, it's the sound that counts, not the inches!

Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed.

I have one of their larger speakers that I love, so I was very disappointed that their app doesn't allow pairing of two of their speakers that aren't identical.

This one has very vintage look, and the material feels high level. I know this may not be very important for a speaker normally. But, this one can be a great decoration or fashion accessory.For the sound itself, it's decent, a little less detailed but very good overall balance. Recommend to anyone want good sound with style.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2024","profile_id":"AEDUFJXKS6VGH74SLESMA6E5KJOQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":2,"product_attributes":"Color: CreamStyle: Emberton II"},{"id":"R1C02YNB7OU6C4","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Looks, feels, sounds good.","author":"Brit","rating":5,"content":"Not much to say.
