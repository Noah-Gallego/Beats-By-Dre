It’s only 1 speaker but I am still able to hear different voices across the highs, lows and mids. It was a choice between this speaker and another speaker that is also very good. This one came in pink so I went with this one. That and frankly it’s for using while I’m moving around and outside. Perfect speaker for that. If I had needed a speaker for using inside I would have gone with the other speaker. Very durable, has some heft to it. Bluetooth connectivity was easy. The speaker came charged so I was able to try it immediately. I’ve paired it with my iPod touch, iPad, iPhone and my pc. No issues at all. I haven’t tried pairing it with my MacBook but I don’t anticipate any problems there either. The pink is a “dusty” pink not a bright in your face pink. Very happy with my choice.
