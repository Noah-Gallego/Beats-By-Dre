The unit misleads you by saying you need to download the app 'Bose connect'. I tried to, but could not get it to download from the App store or from the Bose website. Other Bluetooth speakers connected automatically for me, so this was a hassle. I tried to chat with the Bose help bot, but it was of no help; the lady on the phone at Bose tech support was of no help and disconnected mid-sentence and didn't call me back. I tried to return the item on Amazon, then saw a troubleshooting video. Open your 'systems settings' on your computer and select 'sound'; click the Bose option for speaker 'output'. For some reason this Bose unit doesn't default as the output as other Bluetooth speakers did on my computer. Then you should be able to hear it.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024","profile_id":"AGMDFCAFNSOMPAQOPYPJSNKY2HGA","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Stone Blue"},{"id":"R3PQFUOLSJBHRB","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Bose quality","author":"Tenkiller","rating":5,"content":"Bose has been one of the gold standard in sound for decades. So it‚Äôs not surprising that they pack a lot of quality into this little speaker. For one thing, holds a charge a long time! And it announces each time it‚Äôs turned on how much charge is left. No guessing. The sound quality is really decent for the size of the speaker. It can get very, very loud, if that‚Äôs your thing. It has a bass booster that I usually leave on. I appreciate that it is water resistant as I take this into the bathroom, the kitchen, camping, etc. It paired readily with my iPhone. There are some other features I haven‚Äôt played with yet, like doing my Teams meetings with it using the onboard mic, but I suspect it will be fine. If you are looking for a reasonably small Bluetooth speaker with a big sound without breaking the bank, give it a try.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2024","profile_id":"AG4KHYIUPQPNTJR7JU5GD7DGV7QQ","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Green"},{"id":"RM8XKNWXW2JYF","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars BOSE for the WIN!!!","author":"Onile Stacey","rating":5,"content":"This Bose speaker does not disappoint!

I had no problem connecting my phone and my MacBook Air to the Bose app. I did have to go into my settings and change the output to the Bose speaker, but other than that, the connection is flawless!I recommend this speaker to anyone who wants superb sound on the go or stationary. Oh, and it holds a charge for quite some time. I love how it lets me know how much charge I have remaining and which device it connects to when I turn it on.This is a fun product and also use it for my massage work it really is a handy tool as well.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2024","profile_id":"AFDJQE4XDMVCR3MMLC2F3YAMJ5FQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Chilled Lilac"},{"id":"R2MLVPMTCERUY","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Best small portable bose speaker ever!","author":"Lauren Burke","rating":5,"content":"This is our 4th Bose speaker that we've purchased.

I'm excited to take it to the beach and the pool! I just received it in the mail today and wanted to let others know how great it sounds. Hopefully it lasts awhile! Buy it! You'll love it!

I got two so I could do stereo sound. It has a ‚Äúparty‚Äù setting also. I have a wraparound porch so it stretches the sound out nicely! I like the rubber cover because I use them outside a lot! It was easy to pair it to my phone and to pair up the second speaker. Just follow the instructions provided! This was a great investment because I‚Äôm all about music üé∂ and good sound. I even listen to my podcasts using them. You can adjust the speakers either by the controls on the speaker or by your phone, which is really convenient! Even if I‚Äôm talking on the phone and want the conversation heard, it can come across the speaker! The USB/C charger cord comes with it. It charges very quickly! I like when you turn it on it tells you what the battery level is at and where it is paired to. These are the best little speakers with a huge sound that I have ever had! But then‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a BOSE!!!! The loop on the side makes it possible to hang the speaker easily too. That‚Äôs especially helpful outside on the porch where I have a number of hooks for hanging plants! I don‚Äôt have to worry about its stability, although it has a nice balance of weight to it just to sit it on a railing! If you like what I described, you will want to own one or more!

It's probably a 4/5 there is much better speakers in the market. But, not for that price.

I'm a klutz and I expect I'll knock this over or to the ground at any point. Does not seem sturdy in that capacity. Otherwise it's a thick and dense little speaker.Functions as it's supposed to. Charged well when I got it. I can hear it from the other room when I walk away and it's got a nice clear quality to the speaker so far. The charging cord that came with it was quite short but functional. The speaker and instructions are insistent about downloading a useless connection application. Seems like another way to advertise more speakers or to sell user data. It was irritating enough, I almost rated this less because of it.Speaker will not connect to my phone via Bluetooth unless I allow the speaker access to contact information.

It's compact and that's part of the issue. It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow. Second, the battery life leaves a bit to be desired. It's not as long as other speakers I have had but it's decent. I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected. It's the little details that are missing that list a star. Would I buy again?

I don‚Äôt consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously ‚Äî 100k+ hours annually ‚Äî and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It‚Äôs not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it‚Äôs waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money ‚Äî many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it‚Äôs worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It‚Äôs worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose ‚ÄúRETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.‚Äù I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.
