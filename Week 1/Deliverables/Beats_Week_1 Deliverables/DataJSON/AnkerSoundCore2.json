The sound isn’t quite perfect and I don’t know enough to say what exactly is off. Maybe a bit of treble? The bass is reasonably well represented and it does sound rich, but again, something is just slightly off. No big deal for our use cases, though, and I love it. It gets daily use for 1-2 hours and the battery life has been great. Only had to charge once so far since the initial charge sometime in June.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2024","profile_id":"AECD5MFYRP6ILNERQAMWP5PSBUIA","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R1SQC9SYC8QETW","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars So much life in this little guy!","author":"Whitney Woodward","rating":5,"content":"We bought this little speaker for our workouts.

Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and its C power cord provide a fairly rapid charge. But what impressed me as simple as it may seem are how the audio in and charge connectors are housed into the speaker Located on the side panel the connection ports are securely covered by a rubberized flap that fits snugly into the speaker preventing any moisture or weather elements into the device.The sound is more than adequate given the price point for this unit. The treble and bass range provide added depth tp mosaic jut be aware that the speaker does not have subwoofer functionality. Overall the Anker is a reasonable investment for money.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024","profile_id":"AFA5JOABKCWRE4TZ5L2OEAIG7OUQ","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"RQIZ03YPE4RD1","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars great range","author":"E.

I bought the Soundcore2 as an additional speaker while I wait on the replacement, and the bluetooth drivers are glitchy at best. I can no longer control the volume for the speaker from my computer sound control but instead have to either manually adjust it on the speaker or from inside the browser apps for youtube, tubi and peacock. The sound is decent and it will meet my needs for an external speaker. However, it is disappointing to buy a newer version and it not have the same seamless functionality of the original. Unfortunately, not all changes are for the better.I haven't had it long enough to comment on the battery, but if it behaves like the original, the battery life should be decent. I listen to it a couple of hours a day and only had to recharge it every 7 - 10 days.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024","profile_id":"AFPGBVESRKTAUETDPY5KPKUJZA6A","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R1X425W59YTIZE","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Great Speaker","author":"MikeCallery","rating":5,"content":"I think this is my third one of these - they are great. if I can only remember them when I leave the job site I would still be on m first.I like the fact that they are pretty water resistant.

Long but honest.","author":"Whispering Whiskers","rating":5,"content":"I've been using this product for a couple of years. I really like Anker's products in general. But this one is a must-have product. Here is the detailed list:Pros:Unbelievable Sound: With 12W of pure audio power and dual neodymium drivers, the SoundCore 2 delivers exceptional sound quality with enhanced bass. The advanced digital signal processor ensures zero distortion at any volume level, providing a rich and immersive listening experience.Intense Bass: Thanks to Anker's exclusive BassUp technology and patented spiral bass port, the SoundCore 2 produces deep, thumping bass that enhances the impact of your music, making every beat hit harder and more satisfying.Outdoor-Proof: Boasting IPX7 protection, this speaker is built to withstand the elements, including rain, dust, snow, and spills. Whether you're at home, in the yard, or on the go, you can enjoy incredible sound quality wherever you are without worrying about damage from environmental factors.24H Non-Stop Music: Equipped with Anker's renowned power management technology and a 5,200mAh Li-ion battery, the SoundCore 2 offers up to 24 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. This ensures that you can enjoy your favorite tunes all day long without interruption.Grab, Go, Listen: The SoundCore 2 features a classic design that has been refined and lightened for effortless portability. With simple and intuitive controls located at the top of the speaker, you can easily adjust volume, play/pause music, and activate Bluetooth pairing with minimal effort.Cons:Can't Go to Previous Track: One limitation of the SoundCore 2 is the inability to go to the previous track directly from the speaker. This feature, commonly found in other Bluetooth speakers, is not present in this model, which may inconvenience some users who prefer seamless track navigation.Can't Call the Last Number Dialed: Similarly, the SoundCore 2 lacks the ability to call the last number dialed directly from the speaker, a feature that is typically available in many Bluetooth speakers. This omission may be disappointing for users who rely on this functionality for hands-free calling.No Auxiliary Cable: Unlike some other Bluetooth speakers, the SoundCore 2 does not come with an auxiliary cable included in the package. While Bluetooth connectivity is convenient for wireless audio streaming, having the option for wired connection would have been beneficial for certain situations or devices.In conclusion, despite these minor limitations, the Anker SoundCore 2 Bluetooth Speaker stands out as an excellent choice in its price range. Its durable construction, impressive sound quality, long battery life, and outdoor-proof design make it a versatile and reliable companion for music lovers on the go. While it may not offer all the bells and whistles of higher-end models, its combination of performance and affordability makes it a solid option for anyone in search of a portable and powerful audio solution.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2024","profile_id":"AEBJYDG4R45SPKT2RAGEJ2DDBWNA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":48,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R1RH91CBKJJ5FO","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars My back up.","author":"Quinne Darkover","rating":5,"content":"I thought I had lost my first one but of course the day it arrived I found my old one.

Unfortunately, that speaker started having charging issues and eventually would not hold a charge. I found that disappointing because I hadn't really used it all that much. I decided to get a different brand and had a good experience with Anker and their PowerCore lipstick charging bank, so ordered this one. The sound seems seems better than the clip and the volume goes higher as well. The cost was significantly less than a new clip, so I'm happy about that. We needed an auxiliary input as well, and this one fit the bill. The battery lasts long so I'm loving that. The one thing I'm not crazy about is the shape. It sounds best when the sound is coming right at you, and since it's so flat, I find it difficult to keep it at a slant when I need it to be; but I'm making do. Over all, I am really enjoying this speaker.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024","profile_id":"AFTMAR5EC5BQV5B3N24SJWSZGLHQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":5,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R1KADX0I1EHWSG","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Good value","author":"Ryan Johnson","rating":4,"content":"Decent sound for the price.
