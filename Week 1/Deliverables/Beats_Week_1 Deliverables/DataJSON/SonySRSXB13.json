There seems to be a problem with the pitch of the music and sounds that play through as it seems to sound distorted when the speaker drops to a slightly lower pitch, then to a higher one. For the price, it's a surprising bug, and there are speakers for a fraction of the price without that problem. Another thing is, it is not meticulous on picking up minor details of some music. I do like the volume capabilities in terms of loudness and the speaker does it's intended job well.Video coming soon of problem mentioned.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024","profile_id":"AGZFEX5XJSJN7LNB4OZ526GJBMJA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: XB100Pattern: Speaker"},{"id":"R3PVPR5VIV929O","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound.","author":"Rhonda","rating":5,"content":"I bought two of these for when we go camping.

Speaker is capable of better bass then what's offered in default, but will have to use 3rd party apps, like bass booster or similar. Only complain is if 3rd party apps can make it sound so good, why don't they have built in feature for it. Also it doesn't connect to sony music app.Only 100%, 70%, 50% and 10% battery percentage will be visible on PC or laptop.Connects perfectly to phone all time, no issues. Remember to turn off power as it doesn't automatically turn it off. Leaving on for long with nothing playing drains a lot of battery very fast. After going out of range, it won't connect automatically when back in Bluetooth range.But it's just small issues.

This isnt just two speakers playing identically, this is true stereo sound.2) These sound GOOD. I mean... really good when you consider what you are dealing with. They are about the diameter of a soda can and 2/3 the height, weight is as you'd expect.Overall I am very impressed with these. I guess my only complaint is on certain music types the lows might get a bit 'muddy', but EQ settings on your device can compensate for that.Seriously, go buy two of the 1000 models, you won't regret it.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2024","profile_id":"AEWEXQVAAAYHUXPRWAGUOTX2XBKA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":2,"product_attributes":"Color: Light GrayStyle: XB100Pattern: Speaker"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B08ZJ6DQNY","product_name":"Sony SRSXB13/B Extra Bass Portable Waterproof Speaker with Bluetooth, USB Type-C, 16 Hours Battery Life","parse_status_code":12000},"created_at":"2024-08-09 05:02:00","updated_at":"2024-08-09 05:02:13","page":7,"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08ZJ6DQNY?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=7","job_id":"7227539593946469377","is_render_forced":false,"status_code":200,"parser_type":""},{"content":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08ZJ6DQNY?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8","asin":"B08ZJ6DQNY","page":8,"pages":241,"reviews":[{"id":"R20KGJJTT4NOMS","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars One Sony SRS-XB13 is superb. Two are moreso.","author":"Jonathan","rating":5,"content":"I bought two of these as a gift for a good friend, and we have tested them extensively on his screened-in back porch. We tested them both individually and also paired to play Pandora in stereo from a mid-tier Moto G Stylus smartphone. I have owned several excellent Sony audio products over many decades - from budget to ES level. The SRS-XB13 is a new favorite Sony product of mine. Flossy Carter on YouTube, one of my most reliable go-to reviewers, did a comparison of the Sony XB13 and its most direct competitor, the JBL Clip 4. Flossy included a side-by-side sound demo that I listened to with my Sennheiser HD 600 headphones. Flossy gave the edge to the Sony XB13. Now, having personally heard and tested them, I agree with Flossy Carter about how good the XB13 sounds, especially when paired in a stereo bluetooth link, which is easy to do, once you get the hang of it. Either way, solo or paired, you will get good, balanced high-fidelity sound with reasonably deep and even bass, clear midrange, and nice treble in a smooth and balanced, dynamic presentation with ample loudness. They do not sound cheap or tinny, at all. They sound really great with surprising richness and clarity at all volume levels. In single or stereo use a few feet away, we cannot carry on a normal conversation with the volume set anywhere over 50%. No, these will not replicate the gut-shaking, window-rattling volume of other more expensive and more powerful \"party\" speakers and boom boxes. These are just not meant for that. They are simply great for some semi-quiet to moderately loud or reasonably loud, nice quality music listening you can enjoy indoors or outdoors, perhaps on your back porch or patio while chilling out to your favorites - without having neighbors calling the police on you. I guarantee that you will find it very difficult to believe how truly good, rich, clear, dynamic, and balanced these little marvels from Sony sound, especially in a stereo pair. Aside from Siri and Google Assist and an IP67 water and dustproof rating, a big bonus is long battery life, I believe up to 16 hours at less than 50% volume and about 5 hours with volume over around 80%. They will very pleasantly surprise you and have you shaking your head in disbelief, especially when paired in stereo. I highly recommend one or two, especially while Sony is still making them, probably at a low profit margin.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States October 20, 2022","profile_id":"AHG27OBRBWFLN37XIYR43TV32ZCA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":56,"product_attributes":"Color: BlackStyle: XB13Pattern: Speaker"},{"id":"R27V07HASJ74CD","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound without killing the wallet","author":"joseph carrillo","rating":5,"content":"Firstly I’m ordering three more for others to enjoy the autistic quality while sunning, hiking, or taking in their surroundings","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024","profile_id":"AHYT6ALM5FCV3YUNFVREQ63XUP6Q","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Light GrayStyle: XB100Pattern: Speaker"},{"id":"R1IVWSOR53DVGO","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Small but terrible","author":"Sounds good.
