They paired up immediately, the sound quality is very good (for the price) and I really like the lanyard for carrying them around.No need to carry my android around when doing things around the house or working in the garage. Now I can listen to my play list anywhere I go in the house. The first time I answered a call on my phone I was in the garage with my phone connected to the speakers - It actually slipped my mind that they (speakers) were paired with my phone and was able to take the call and listen and speak as I walked around.There's a couple more features I want to try and afterwards I will update my review. So far everything is as advertised on Amazon. Good dealUPDATE to my original review - I found out when my speakers needed to be recharged that they have Micro USB Ports (old cell phone charging ports). They should have been fitted with the newer USB-C ports. I had to search for my old charging cables to recharge them.My excellent rating review went down because of this.Another update 5-22-2024I've had one MusiBaby speaker since January, I liked the first one, so I bought another one in February, to pair them.When it came time to charge, I noticed they had the older cell phone charging ports Micro USB (Type A) instead of the newer USB-C (has no up or down orientation). I found this annoying at first but after pairing them and listening to my playlists on them, decided it was no big deal. The quality of sound surpasses the charging port jacks.I did lose the ability to pair them on one speaker, after a few months of constant use, but after contacting their Customer Service, they quickly sent replacement.I also have to add that their customer service department is exceptional. They took a while to look at my original review, but they did respond promptly after.After all is said and done, I've updated my review to Five (5) Stars all around","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2024","profile_id":"AEE67INBNBNNOCCJ427MVATNE4BQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":25,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"RYER08P6MAN31","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Tiene un tamaño cómoda vale cada peso que vale","author":"Erika","rating":5,"content":"Se escucha muy bien y con mucha calidad es para un regalo y me pareció increíble después compraré otra para mi","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024","profile_id":"AF3KKRARNXFQMVYW5RF7KPFC3KDQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":8,"product_attributes":"Color: Red"},{"id":"R18I5UMXN81Y4U","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Great speaker.","author":"Randy Roberts","rating":4,"content":"I enjoy pod casts and this speaker works very well, very good sound.
